### Execution Context
  - As soon as the JS Engine sees '()', it creates something called an Execution Context.
  - After the JS Engine creates an Execution Context, it adds it to the Call Stack.
  - Global Execution context is the base execution context.
  - Global Execution context is created initially under the hood.
  - Global Execution context gives us two objects: 'Global Object' and 'this'.
  - In the browser, the global object is 'window'.
  - Creation phase is the first phase in the JavaScript engine.
  - Execution phase is the 2nd phase in the JavaScript engine.
